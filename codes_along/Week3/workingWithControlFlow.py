# #2 Loop: for loop: used to iterating over a sequence (picking one by one)
# #LIST: Iterates through each element in a list
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(f'I like {fruit}')

# #TUPLE iterates through elements in a tuple, it is immutable unlike list
# coordinates = (0.3464, -0.47557, 0.587)
# for point in coordinates:
#     print(f"Point: {point}")

# #DICT iterates through each element (Key : Element)
# student =  {"name" : "Tunde", "Age" :  16, "Grade" : "A"}
# for key, value in student.items():
#     print(f"{key} : {value}")

# #STRING iterates through each element in a string in form of sequences of characters
# word = "PYTHON"
# for char in word:
#     print(char)


#WHILE loop is condition-based, used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true otherwise it stops

## Documenting my thoughts##
# Let the loop start with count = 3
# Let it keep printing until count is greater than 15 adding 2 per number
# Let the loop terminate when the condition is no longer true

# count = 3
# while count <= 15:
#     print("Number:", count)
#     count += 2

#incrementing with "while"
# num = 10
# while num <= 100:
#     print(num, end=" ") #start printing from 10 and end on 100 adding 10 to each count
#     num += 10

# #decrementing with "while"
# timer = 100
# while timer >= 10:
#     print("Countdown:", timer)
#     timer -= 10

# password = ""

#             break

# for num in range (1, 6):
#     if num == 3: # This is to skip 3
#         continue
#     print(num)
# it is used to skip invalid data, ignore unwanted characters eg spaces in a string 

#PASS does nothing, it is used if code hasnot been written but you want to keep the structure
# for num in range(1, 6):
#     if num == 3:
#         pass
#     else:
