# #assignment operators are used to assign values to variables, also combine an operator with assignment,so instead of x = x + 5, we can write X += 5
# #Example 
# x = 10
# print("Initial value:", x)
# x += 5
# print("After x += 5", x)
# x -= 2
# print("After x -= 2:", x)
# x *= 3
# print("After x *= 3:", x)
# x /= 4
# print("after x /= 4:", x)
# x %= 3 
# # print("After x %= 3:", x)

# x = 4
# x **= 2 
# print("After x **= 2:", x)
# x //= 3
# print("After x //= 3:", x)

# balance = 1000
# deposit = 200
# withdraw = 150
# balance += deposit #= 1200 add deposit
# balance -= withdraw #850 subtract withdrawal
# print("Updated Balance:", balance)

#logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and it work with boolean values. They are and,  or , and not
x = 10
