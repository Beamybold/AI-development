"""
THE LOGICAL PROCESS
accepted ussd from user, use strip to mitigate user error
checks if the user USSD input is right
used while True to ensure that the programs runs as long as the specified conditions are satisfied, otherwise, it prints an error message and restarts the loop

Accepts input from user regarding their desired service (for example, check balance...)
check if the user's input aligns with any of the predefined premises, for example, an input of  1 = should check data and airtime balance. Else it prints an error message and restarts the loop
If the user's input aligns with the required condition it prints out the appropriate messages, and breaks the program

#ask user if they want to register another seat, if yes restart the program, else end the program?
#what if they want to book multiple seats at a time?
